**Present Moment**
* Started doing rituals from the book today. Feel exhausted because had to visualize a lot and also confused at many materials
to read
* Also started downloading books for further study soon

**Present Moment**
* Got some balloon today, but the balloon is small in terms of available gas => after a hit or two => decided that the gas is fake in terms of size and not enough anymore. Looks can be deceiving. If had a lot of money as the guy next to me, probably will not see that the balloon is fake, will not filter => boundaries and limitation helps filter bullshit
* Try meditate on "The High Priestess" today to see which image yet it disappears to the right by somekind of saw
* See many thoughts pattern on "not doing the ritual today" yet realize that it's could be an animal soul
* King Paimon stayed with in the darkness so must appreciate those who stay with in the darkness. When things are easy, it's very hard to be a good guy
* Decided that the place is not appropriate for me anymore so breath in the seven law of Hermetic in the dry balloon and ask King Paimon to guide me. 
* Daily Ritual: Get veli nice visualization today, faster 
* Looking at one point while having a lot of thoughts => create **two points** if not concentrated
