**Present Moment**
* Got some balloon today, but the balloon is small in terms of available gas => after a hit or two => decided that the gas is fake in terms of size and not enough anymore. Looks can be deceiving. If had a lot of money as the guy next to me, probably will not see that the balloon is fake, will not filter => boundaries and limitation helps filter bullshit
* Try meditate on "The High Priestess" today to see which image yet it disappears to the right by somekind of saw
* See many thoughts pattern on "not doing the ritual today" yet realize that it's could be an animal soul
* King Paimon stayed with in the darkness so must appreciate those who stay with in the darkness. When things are easy, it's very hard to be a good guy
* Decided that the place is not appropriate for me anymore so breath in the seven law of Hermetic in the dry balloon and ask King Paimon to guide me. 
* Daily Ritual: Get veli nice visualization today, faster 
* Looking at one point while having a lot of thoughts => create **two points** if not concentrated

**Present Moment**
* Saw that emotion that leads to wrong perception about a thing. But come back to balloon place and sit at a different direction to see from different perspectives. Emotion leads to misunderstanding
* Break the contract with the spirits there asking the help of king Paimon and feel two spirit coming out of body
* In order to expand, don't be afraid to step outside of comfort zone and ask. Ask one things at a time. 
* Balloon can only act as medicine to summarise and remember many things, real progress comes from reading books 
* Went under balloon but without question and intention, will only leads to fluctuating thoughts. 
* Limitation leads to real progress. 
* Thank you Saturn, thank you king Paimon, thank you archangels.

**Present Moment**
* Get Saturn lesson today: the way to overcome something is to get used to it
* Angels and Demons get their place in this world. Better know their place than banish, especially demon away. 
* Staring at one point today and get perception distorted by the color of eyes. 
* People who think they understand things and say it out loud are people who know least. 
* Otherwise get very good meditation today. Thank you Saturn and king Paimon and archangels.
